# scala-neural-network
Neural network implemented in scala

This project is a kind of kata for me, I have already implemented basic framework for neural networks in several languages.

Dependencies:
- scalamock-core 2.11-3.2
- scalamock-scalatest-support 2.11-3.2
- scalatest 2.11-2.2.1
 
It now supports sbt!

Compile:
sbt compile

Run unittests:
sbt test

This project is unfinished.

Learning is now added (classic backpropagation), but it is not tested yet (other then unit tests, but those aren't really good for testing learning algorithms), so expect it not to work at the moment.
