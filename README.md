# scala-neural-network
Neural network implemented in scala

This project is a kind of kata for me, I have already implemented basic framework for neural networks in several languages.

Dependencies:
- scalamock-core 2.11-3.2
- scalamock-scalatest-support 2.11-3.2
- scalatest 2.11-2.2.1
 
It now supports sbt!

Compile:
sbt compile

Run unittests:
sbt test

This project is unfinished.

Learning is now added (classic backpropagation).

TODO: Add more tests for learning.
