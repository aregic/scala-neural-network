# scala-neural-network
Neural network implemented in scala

This project is a kind of kata for me, I have already implemented basic framework for neural networks in several languages.

Dependencies:
- sclamock-core 2.11-3.2
- scalamock-scalatest-support 2.11-3.2
- scalatest 2.11-2.2.1
 
I will create an sbt definition for these ASAP.
This project is unfinished, no learning is added yet.
